# In this project I was asked to calculate several things withing a list of profit/loss statments from a bank and then save it as a text file:
#The total number of months included in the dataset
#The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# I was also asked to calculate several things within a political poll and save it as a text:
#The total number of votes cast
#A complete list of candidates who received votes
#The percentage of votes each candidate won
#The total number of votes each candidate won
#The winner of the election based on popular vote.
